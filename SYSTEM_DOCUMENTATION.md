### Architecture Pattern

**Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    TimeWise Platform                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Organization A  │  Organization B  │  Organization C   │
│  (Tenant 1)      │  (Tenant 2)      │  (Tenant 3)       │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│  Staff: 25       │  Staff: 150      │  Staff: 8         │
│  Plan: Starter   │  Plan: Enterprise│  Plan: Pro        │
│  Data: Isolated  │  Data: Isolated  │  Data: Isolated   │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

**Key Architectural Features:**
- **Tenant Isolation:** Each organization's data is completely isolated
- **Shared Infrastructure:** All tenants share the same codebase and database
- **Scalable:** Can support unlimited organizations
- **Secure:** Row-level security with automatic tenant filtering

---

## 🎨 Core Features

### 1. **Multi-Tenant Organization Management**

**What It Does:**
- Allows unlimited organizations to use the same platform
- Each organization has its own isolated workspace
- Subdomain-based access (e.g., `acme.timewise.com`)
- Independent settings, staff, and data per organization

**How It Works:**
- Every database query automatically includes `tenantId` filter
- Prevents cross-tenant data access
- Organizations can customize their settings independently

**Use Case:**
> Company A (retail store) and Company B (tech startup) both use TimeWise. Company A tracks 50 retail staff with QR codes, while Company B tracks 200 remote employees with face recognition. Their data never mixes.

---

### 2. **User Authentication & Security**

**Features:**
- ✅ Email/Password registration
- ✅ Email verification with OTP (6-digit code)
- ✅ Secure password reset flow
- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Staff)
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Rate limiting on sensitive operations

**Security Measures:**
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- JWT tokens with expiration
- OTP codes expire in 10 minutes
- Max 5 OTP verification attempts
- Rate limiting: 3 OTP requests per minute
- Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- HTTPS enforcement in production

**User Flow:**
```
Register → Verify Email (OTP) → Login → Dashboard
                ↓
         Forgot Password? → Reset Link → New Password → Login
```

---

### 3. **Staff Management**

**Features:**
- ✅ Add/Edit/Delete staff members
- ✅ Automatic unique staff ID generation
- ✅ QR code generation for each staff
- ✅ Department and position tracking
- ✅ Email notifications (optional)
- ✅ Bulk operations
- ✅ Search and filter capabilities
- ✅ Staff limit enforcement based on plan

**Staff Data Structure:**
```typescript
{
  staffId: "STAFF1234",
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@company.com",
  department: "Engineering",
  position: "Software Developer",
  qrCode: "base64_encoded_qr_image",
  isActive: true,
  biometricData: { faceId: "aws_rekognition_id" },
  createdAt: "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Use Case:**
> HR manager adds 20 new employees. System generates unique IDs (STAFF1001-STAFF1020), creates QR codes, and sends welcome emails. Each employee can download their QR code for check-in.

---

### 4. **Multiple Check-In Methods**

#### **A. QR Code Check-In**
- Staff scans their unique QR code
- Instant check-in/check-out
- Works offline (QR codes stored locally)
- Downloadable and printable QR codes

#### **B. Manual Entry**
- Staff enters their Staff ID
- Useful when QR code is unavailable
- Validates ID before check-in

#### **C. Face Recognition (Biometric)**
- Uses AWS Rekognition
- Captures photo and matches against registered face
- Prevents buddy punching
- 99.9% accuracy

#### **D. Fingerprint (Future)**
- Hardware integration planned
- For high-security environments

**Check-In Flow:**
```
1. Staff arrives at work
2. Opens check-in page (requires passcode)
3. Chooses method (QR/Manual/Face)
4. System captures:
   - Timestamp
   - Location (optional)
   - Photo (if enabled)
   - Method used
5. Determines status:
   - On Time (before 9:00 AM)
   - Late (after 9:00 AM)
6. Records in database
7. Shows confirmation
```

---

### 5. **Photo Verification**

**Purpose:** Prevent attendance fraud (buddy punching, proxy check-ins)

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic photo capture on check-in/check-out
- ✅ Stored securely in database
- ✅ Configurable retention period (1-30 days)
- ✅ Auto-deletion after retention period
- ✅ Can be enabled/disabled per organization
- ✅ Privacy-compliant

**How It Works:**
1. When staff checks in, camera activates
2. Photo captured automatically
3. Stored with attendance record
4. Admin can review photos in dashboard
5. Photos deleted after configured days (default: 7)

**Use Case:**
> Company suspects an employee is having colleagues check in for them. Admin reviews photos and confirms the fraud. Policy updated, and photo verification prevents future incidents.
